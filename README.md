# NeuroExploration
   Using sample data collected off of 'http://ric.uthscsa.edu/mango/download.html', manipulated the file to collect regions of interest based off of brain activity. An approximation of brain activity to image intensity was made as the central assumption for this study. Jupyter notebook was used as a framework for this experiment.
